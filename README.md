# Serverless Sum Calculation with AWS API Gateway and Lambda

This project demonstrates a serverless architecture to calculate the sum of two numbers using AWS services. It utilizes AWS API Gateway to receive requests, AWS Lambda to perform the calculation, and Amazon SNS for notifications.

Features
- Serverless Architecture: Fully managed AWS services for scalable and cost-effective solutions.
- API Gateway: Exposes an HTTP endpoint for receiving input data 
- AWS Lambda: Executes the sum calculation in response to API requests.
- SNS Notifications: Sends email notifications with the calculated result.
